# üì• Import Existing Projects to PostgreSQL

After deploying to Railway, you'll need to import your 5 existing projects from SQL Server.

## Option 1: Using Railway Dashboard (Easiest)

### Step 1: Connect to PostgreSQL
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click on PostgreSQL database
3. Click "Data" tab
4. You'll see a query editor

### Step 2: Insert Projects One by One
Copy and run these SQL commands in Railway's query editor:

```sql
-- Project 1: Manchester City
INSERT INTO projects (title, short_description, full_description, technologies, github_url, live_demo_url, category, status, impact_metrics, cover_image_path)
VALUES (
  'Manchester City WSL Championship Analytics',
  'Converting ¬£2.5M transfer budget into measurable competitive advantage through advanced predictive analytics.',

### For NYC Delivery Project (with uploaded files):
This project has images and video in `uploads/` folder. You'll need to:

1. **Upload files to Cloudinary first:**
   - Go to https://cloudinary.com dashboard
   - Click "Media Library"
   - Upload these files from your local `uploads/` folder:
     - `1759225376611-Image 30-9-2025 at 6.15√¢¬ØPM.png`
     - `1759225376621-Image 30-9-2025 at 6.11√¢¬ØPM.png`
     - `1759225376621-Image 30-9-2025 at 6.09√¢¬ØPM.png`
     - `1759225376622-Image 30-9-2025 at 6.10√¢¬ØPM.png` (x3)
     - `1759225711904-new_recording_-_9_30_2025,_5_30_05_pm (720p).mp4`

2. **Get Cloudinary URLs:**
   After upload, Cloudinary will give you URLs like:
   `https://res.cloudinary.com/YOUR_CLOUD_NAME/image/upload/v1234567890/filename.png`

3. **Insert project with Cloudinary URLs:**
```sql
INSERT INTO projects (
  title, short_description, full_description, technologies,
  github_url, category, status, impact_metrics,
  cover_image_path, additional_images_paths, demo_video_path
)
VALUES (
  'NYC Delivery Promise Engine',
  'Production-style ML prototype fusing 3.8M+ NYC trip records to predict reliable ETAs (P50/P90) and delay risk.',
  '## Project Overview...[full description from backup]',
  'Python,ML Tools,Regression,Random Forest,Basic Trees,Model Training,Scikit-learn',
  'https://github.com/ozzy2438/ClearPromise-NYC.git',
  'Machine Learning',
  'active',
  'Reduced late deliveries 50% ‚Üí 10%, saving $4.1M annually; Increased revenue $2.3M/year via surge pricing',
  'YOUR_CLOUDINARY_URL_FOR_COVER_IMAGE',
  'CLOUDINARY_URL_1,CLOUDINARY_URL_2,CLOUDINARY_URL_3,CLOUDINARY_URL_4,CLOUDINARY_URL_5',
  'YOUR_CLOUDINARY_VIDEO_URL'
);
```

## Option 2: Use Admin Panel (After Deployment)

Once your site is live:

1. Go to `https://your-netlify-site.netlify.app/admin.html`
2. Add each project manually using the form
3. Upload images/videos through the interface
4. Cloudinary will handle everything automatically

**Pros:**
- No SQL needed
- Visual interface
- Automatic file upload to Cloudinary

**Cons:**
- Takes longer (but only 10-15 minutes for 5 projects)
- Need to re-enter all text content

---

## üí° Recommendation

**Use Option 2 (Admin Panel)** because:
- ‚úÖ Easier - no SQL knowledge needed
- ‚úÖ Files automatically go to Cloudinary
- ‚úÖ Visual confirmation everything works
- ‚úÖ You can verify each project looks good before moving to next

Just copy-paste the content from `projects-backup.json` into the admin form fields!

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

After migration, you can delete:
- `server.js` (old SQL Server version)
- `.env` (old credentials - don't commit!)
- `projects-backup.json` (after confirming data is migrated)

Keep using `server-postgres.js` as your production backend.
