    "full_description": "<h2>Background and Overview</h2><p>Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) represent a critical challenge in healthcare, costing the US healthcare system <strong>$30-136 billion annually</strong> and causing over <strong>100,000 deaths per year</strong>. Traditional manual pharmacovigilance processes struggle to keep pace with the volume of reports—the FDA receives millions of adverse event reports that require systematic analysis to identify safety signals before they result in patient harm.</p><h2>The Problem Solved</h2><p>This project addresses this challenge by building an <strong>automated signal detection system</strong> that analyzes 1.47 million FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) reports to identify potential drug safety concerns. Using established statistical methodologies (Proportional Reporting Ratio and Reporting Odds Ratio), the system detected over 1 million potential signals and intelligently prioritized them down to 34,542 high-risk alerts—a <strong>97.5% reduction</strong> that makes the findings actionable for pharmacovigilance teams.</p><h2>Clinical Validation</h2><p>The system was validated against the CRESCENDDI clinical reference dataset, achieving <strong>47% sensitivity</strong> in detecting known drug-drug interaction risks, with successful identification of high-risk combinations including:</p><ul><li><strong>Apixaban-Hemorrhage:</strong> PRR 22.4 (11× above threshold)</li><li><strong>Digoxin-Bradycardia:</strong> PRR 32.5</li><li><strong>Mercaptopurine-Neutropenia:</strong> PRR 156.2</li><li><strong>Methotrexate-Hepatotoxicity:</strong> PRR 24.8</li><li><strong>Warfarin-Subdural Hematoma:</strong> PRR 18.9</li></ul><h2>Business Value</h2><p>This automated approach enables pharmaceutical companies, healthcare providers, and regulatory agencies to detect safety signals months or years earlier than traditional methods, potentially preventing patient harm and reducing liability exposure. The system processes 1.47M reports in under 2 hours on standard hardware, making it production-ready for real-world deployment.</p>",
